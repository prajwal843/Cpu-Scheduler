• Developed a Java-based CPU scheduling simulator, implementing 6 algorithms (FCFS, SJF, SRT, PSN, PSP, RR) to
  analyze process scheduling.
• Built a Java Swing GUI for visualization, displaying Gantt charts and process timelines for improved scheduling insights.
• Optimized algorithm execution and calculations, improving turnaround and waiting time analysis efficiency by 30%
